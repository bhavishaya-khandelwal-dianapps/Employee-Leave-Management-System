# Employee-Leave-Management-System


============================= Overview ====================================

The Employee Leave Management System is a web-based application designed to help organizations manage employee leave requests, track leave balances, and monitor the status of active leave requests. The system simplifies the process for employees to request leave, for HR personnel to approve or deny those requests, and for management to oversee and approve HR leave requests.
